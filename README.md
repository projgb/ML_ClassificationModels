## Understanding Classification models under Supervised Machine Learning

# Introduction 
Classification models are used for categorical data to estimate discrete values (binary values) or classes (lanugage on webpage, type of flower), as opposed to Regression models used for continuous (numerical) data to estimate specific values (saleprice of property).
Various classification models are k-Nearest neighbour (KNN), Logistics Regression, Decision Tree, k-means, Support Vector Machine.

# Description of learning
Iris dataset is used to predict classes of Iris from a given test set. Comparison of outcome from all models is compared and displayed.
